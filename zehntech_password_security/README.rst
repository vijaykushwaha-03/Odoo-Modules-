**Key Features**
================================================================

- **Auto-Expire Password For Security**:Requires users to update their passwords regularly, reducing the likelihood of long-term vulnerabilities.
This ensures that even if an account is compromised, the attacker has limited time to exploit the credentials.
- **Set Flexible Secure Password Length**:Enforces a minimum password length to ensure stronger security. Longer passwords are harder to 
crack through brute-force attacks, providing greater protection against unauthorized access while discouraging weak or easily 
guessable passwords.
- **Enforce Strong Password Rules**:Requires passwords to include a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
  This strengthens security by ensuring passwords are not simple, easily guessed, or susceptible to common attack methods like
  dictionary attacks.
- **Prevent Password Reuse**:Prevents users from reusing old passwords by tracking past passwords. This ensures that individuals
  create new, unique passwords each time, reducing the risk of repeated vulnerabilities and making it more difficult for attackers
  to compromise accounts.
- **Control Password Reset Frequency**:Prevents users from frequently resetting their passwords to quickly cycle through different passwords.
  This policy enforces a minimum time between password changes, ensuring a more secure password environment and making it harder for
  attackers to bypass security policies.
- **Auto Email Reminders Of Password Expiration**:Users will receive notifications via email 5 days prior to their password expiration date.
